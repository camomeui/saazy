  Don't worry. This is a fake message.

You're redirected from `/api/*.ts` serverless function (unless you came here via navigation menu).

Check out the handler function in `/pages/api/*.ts` to actually handle the form submission.

In case any error occurs, user will be redirected to `/pages/failure`.
