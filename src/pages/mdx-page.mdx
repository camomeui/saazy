import MdxPageLayout from "@/layouts/MdxPageLayout";

export const meta = {
  title: "MDX Page",
  description: "This is description text",
  thumb: {
    src: "/images/office-chairs.webp",
    alt: "Office",
  },
  date: "2023-02-12",
  backButton: {
    href: "/",
    content: "Go back",

export default ({ children }) => (

You can easily create static pages by adding `[slug].mdx` file under the `/pages` directory.

Any MDX (and Markdown) features are supported the same as the blog.

See [Markdown Guide](/docs/cms/markdown) for details.
