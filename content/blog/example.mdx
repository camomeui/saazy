## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

## Syntax guide

Here’s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files.

### Headings

```txt
## This is a h2 tag

### This is a h3 tag

#### This is a h4 tag
```

## This is a h2 tag

### This is a h3 tag

#### This is a h4 tag

:::info
h2 should be the top-level heading instead of h1 which is for the title.
:::

### Emphasis

```txt
_This text will be italic_

**This text will be bold**

_You **can** combine them_
```

_This text will be italic_

**This text will be bold**

_You **can** combine them_

### Strikethrough

Any word wrapped with two tildes (like `~~this~~`) will appear ~~crossed out~~.

### Lists

#### Unordered

```txt
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b
```

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b

#### Ordered

```txt
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b
```

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b

### Images

```txt

```

### Links

```txt
http://github.com

[GitHub](http://github.com)
```

### Blockquotes

```txt
As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.
```

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

### Inline code

```txt
I think you should use an `<addr>` element here instead.
```

I think you should use an `<addr>` element here instead.

### Syntax highlighting

Here’s an example of how you can use syntax highlighting with [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/):

````txt
```js title="/lib/sum.js"
// Some comments
function sum(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```
````

And here's how it looks - nicely colored with styled code titles!

```js title="/lib/sum.js"
// Some comments
function sum(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

### Messages

```txt
:::info
You can use **Markdown** inside `Message`.
:::

:::warn
You can use **Markdown** inside `Message`.
:::

:::danger
You can use **Markdown** inside `Message`.
:::
```

:::info
You can use **Markdown** inside `Message`.
:::

:::warn
You can use **Markdown** inside `Message`.
:::

:::danger
You can use **Markdown** inside `Message`.
:::

### Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

```txt
| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |
```

| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |
