## How to write docs

See [CMS overview](/docs/cms/overview#how-to-write-blogdocs) for writing content in Markdown.

## Sidebar

You can define the order, label, and categories of items in the sidebar by editing `/content/docs/_sidebar.js`.

```js title="/content/docs/_sidebar.js"
/** @type {import('@/types').DocsSidebarConfig} */
const sidebar = {
  items: [
    // Link items.
    {
      id: "introduction", // Specify `Docs.id`. This defaults to `Docs.slug` but you can change in front matter.
    },
    {
      id: "development",
      label: "Custom label", // `Docs.title` is used if not supplied.
    },
    // Category item.
    {
      id: "cms", // Currently this ID is not related anywhere.
      label: "CMS",
      open: true, // Specify whether it's open by default or not.
      // If `items` is supplied this is treated as a category.
      items: [
        {
          id: "cms/blog", // Sub-directory is supported, but not mandatory for creating categories.
        },
        {
          id: "cms/docs",
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
};
```
