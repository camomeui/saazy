## How to write blog

See [CMS overview](/docs/cms/overview#how-to-write-blogdocs) for writing content in Markdown.

## Authors

You can define an author of blog posts in `/content/authors.ts`.

If `author` field in a blog post is undefined, `defaultAuthor` in [siteData](/docs/site-configuration#site-data-object) is used.

## Tags

Simply add `tags` field in the blog posts and all tags are automatically aggregated under `/blog/tags/[slug]` routes.

:::info
You don't need to pre-define tags somewhere else than posts' metadata.
:::

## Caveats

### Nested routes are not supported

All md/mdx files are expected to be placed at the **top level** of the `/content/blog` directory.

- DO - `/content/blog/post.mdx`
- DON'T - `/content/blog/category/post.mdx`
