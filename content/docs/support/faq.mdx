## What do "free updates" include?

Once you purchase our product, any improvements listed below will always be free:

- Feature improvements
- Bug fixes
- Upgrade of dependencies

Updates are applied to the download content on Gumroad. You are responsive for downloading, merging the changes into your code base, and ensuring no regression is introduced.

## What kind of support do you provide?

While we do offer support for things like licensing-related concerns, customers are expected to have the requisite knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Next.js to use the product successfully.

However, in case you face a serious bug, please file an issue to our [GitHub community](https://github.com/sabigara/camome-community).

**In short:**

- We **DO** fix serious bugs introduced by ourselves
- We **DON'T** offer support for questions about how to use our products
