## How to customize the theme

Most colors, shadows, and border-radius are defined as [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) in `/public/styles/tokens.css`. Modify the values to change the looks and feelings.

For example, you can change `--camome-color-primary-*` to apply your company's brand color. Colors of buttons, links, and highlights can be controlled from only a single CSS file!

You may want to choose color shades from [Tailwind's default color palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#default-color-palette).
