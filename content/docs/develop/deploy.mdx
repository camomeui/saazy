## Next App

[Vercel](https://vercel.com) is the easiest hosting service for Next.js apps (Next.js is built by them).

It should be fine if the platform supports `next/image`, but **Vercel is the only officially supported service**.

## Static App

As Static App is just a pile of static files, it should work on any hosting service.

Here are some hosting services that offer free/cheap plans for static sites:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc1=h_ls)
